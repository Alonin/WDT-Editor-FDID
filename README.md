Editor for post 8.1.5 WDT files. 

It's recommended you update 
listfileonlyadts.csv (listfile of root adts only.) andsplitfiles01.csv (listfile of split adt files.) before use. You could replace them with a full listfile but it currently slows the processing down drastically so I recommend extracting only .adt files from a full listfile.
